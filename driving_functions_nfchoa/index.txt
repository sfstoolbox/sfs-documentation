Driving functions for |NFC-HOA| and |SDM|
-----------------------------------------

In the following, driving functions for |NFC-HOA| and |SDM| are derived
for spherical, circular, and linear secondary source distributions. Among the
possible combinations of methods and secondary sources not all are meaningful.
Hence, only the relevant ones will be presented. The same holds for the
introduced source models of plane waves, point sources, line sources and focused
sources. [AhrensSpors2010]_ in addition have considered |SDM|
driving functions for planar secondary source distributions.

For |NFC-HOA|, temporal-domain implementations for the
2.5D cases are available for a plane wave and a point source as source models. The
derivation of the implementation is not explicitly shown here, but is described
in [Spors2011]_.
