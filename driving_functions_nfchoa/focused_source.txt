Focused Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focused sources mimic point or line sources that are located inside the audience
area. For the single-layer potential the assumption is that the audience area is
free from sources and sinks. However, a focused source is neither of them. It
represents a sound field that converges towards a focal point and diverges
afterwards. This can be achieved by reversing the driving function of a point or
line source in time which is known as time reversal focusing [Yon2003]_.

Nonetheless, the single-layer potential should not be solved for focused sources
without any approximation. In the near field of a source, evanescent waves
appear for spatial frequencies :math:`k_x > |\wc |` [Williams1999]_,
eq. (24). They decay exponentially with the distance from the source.  An exact
solution for a focused source is supposed to include these evanescent waves
around the focal point. That is only possible by applying very large amplitudes
to the secondary sources, compare Fig. 2a in [SporsAhrens2010]_. Since the
evanescent waves decay rapidly and are hence not influencing the perception,
they can easily be omitted. For corresponding driving functions for focused
sources without the evanescent part of the sound field see [SporsAhrens2010]_
for |SDM| and [AhrensSpors2009b]_ for |NFC-HOA|.

In the SFS Toolbox only focused sources in |WFS| are considered at the moment.
