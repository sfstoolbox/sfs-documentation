Sound Field Synthesis
=====================

Sound field synthesis (SFS) includes all methods that try to generate a defined
sound field in an extended area that is surrounded by loudspeakers. This page
focuses on those methods that provide analytical solutions to the underlying
mathematical problem, namely |WFS|, |NFC-HOA|, and the |SDM|.

The Toolboxes provide you with the implementation of the underlying mathematics.
You can make numerical simulations of the resulting sound fields and can even
create binaural simulations of the same sound fields. This enables you to listen
to large loudspeaker arrays, even if you donâ€™t have one in your laboratory or at
home. In addition, you can easily plug-in your own algorithms in order to test
or compare them.

The SFS Toolbox project is structured in the following three sub-projects.

Most of the figures in this page are directly created by the SFS Toolbox for
Python. All of them display the corresponding code for creating them directly
before the actual figure. In order to recreate them, you have to execute the
following code first:

.. Common plotting settings
.. plot::
    :context: reset

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import sfs
    plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 8, 4.5  # inch
