Circular Geometries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following functions build a basis in :math:`\mathbb{R}^2` for a circular
secondary source distribution [Williams1999]_

.. math::
    :label: circular-harmonics

    \Phi_m(\phi) = \e{\i m\phi}.

The complex conjugate of :math:`\Phi_m` is given by negating the degree
:math:`m` as

.. math::
    :label: circular-harmonics-complex-conjugate

    \Phi_m(\phi)^* = \Phi_{-m}(\phi).

For a circular secondary source distribution with a radius of :math:`R_0` the
driving function can be calculated by a convolution along the surface of the
circle as explicitly shown by [AhrensSpors2009a]_ and is then given as

.. math::
    :label: D_circular

    D_\text{circular}(\phi_0,\w) =
        \frac{1}{2\pi R_0} \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty
        \frac{\breve{S}_m(\phi_\text{s},r_\text{s},\w)}
        {\breve{G}_m(0,\w)} \, \Phi_m(\phi_0),

where :math:`\breve{S}_m` denotes the circular expansion coefficients for the
source model, :math:`\phi_\text{s}`, and :math:`r_\text{s}` its directional
dependency, and :math:`\breve{G}_m` the circular expansion coefficients for a
secondary monopole source. For a line source located at :math:`\x_0 = (0,R_0)`
this is given as

.. math::
    :label: G_circular

    \breve{G}_m(0,\w) = -\frac{\i}{4}
        \Hankel{2}{m}{\wc R_0},

where :math:`\Hankel{2}{m}{}` describes the Hankel function of :math:`m`-th
order and second kind.
