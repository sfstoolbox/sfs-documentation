Solution for Special Geometries: |NFC-HOA| and |SDM|
----------------------------------------------------

The integral equation :eq:`single-layer` states a Fredholm equation of first
kind with a Green’s function as kernel. This type of equation can be solved in a
straightforward manner for geometries that have a complete set of orthogonal
basis functions.  Then the involved functions are expanded into the basis
functions :math:`\psi_n` as [MorseFeshbach1981]_, p. (940)

.. math::
    :label: G_expansion

    G(\x-\x_0, \w) = \sum_{n} \tilde{G}_n(\w) \psi_n^*(\x_0) \psi_n(\x)

.. math::
    :label: D_expansion

    D(\x_0, \w) = \sum_n \tilde{D}_n(\w) \psi_n(\x_0)

.. math::
    :label: S_expansion

    S(\x, \w) = \sum_n \tilde{S}_n(\w) \psi_n(\x),

where :math:`\tilde{G}_n, \tilde{D}_n, \tilde{S}_n` denote the series expansion
coefficients, :math:`n \in \mathbb{Z}`, and \ :math:`\langle\psi_n,
\psi_{n'}\rangle = 0\,` for :math:`n \ne n'`.
If the underlying space is not compact the equations will involve an integration
instead of a summation

.. math::
    :label: G_expansion_non_compact

    G(\x-\x_0, \w) = \int \tilde{G}(\mu, \w) \psi^*(\mu, \x_0)
        \psi(\mu, \x) \d\mu

.. math::
    :label: D_expansion_non_compact

    D(\x_0, \w) = \int \tilde{D}(\mu, \w) \psi(\mu, \x_0) \d\mu

.. math::
    :label: S_expansion_non_compact

    S(\x, \w) = \int \tilde{S}(\mu, \w) \psi(\mu, \x) \d\mu,

where :math:`\d\mu` is the measure in the underlying space.
Introducing these equations into :eq:`single-layer` one gets

.. math::
    :label: D_HOA

    \tilde{D}_n(\w) =
        \frac{\tilde{S}_n(\w)}{\tilde{G}_n(\w)}.

This means that the Fredholm equation :eq:`single-layer` states a convolution.
For geometries where the required orthogonal basis functions exist, :eq:`D_HOA`
follows directly via the convolution theorem [ArfkenWeber2005]_, eq. (1013).
Due to the division of the desired sound field by the spectrum of the Green’s
function this kind of approach has been named |SDM| [AhrensSpors2010]_.  For
circular and spherical geometries the term |NFC-HOA| is more common due to the
corresponding basis functions. “Near-field compensated” highlights the usage of
point sources as secondary sources in contrast to Ambisonics and |HOA| that
assume plane waves as secondary sources.

The challenge is to find a set of basis functions for a given geometry.
In the following paragraphs three simple geometries and their widely
known sets of basis functions will be discussed.
