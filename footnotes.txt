.. [#F1] Note that :math:`\sin\theta` is used here instead of :math:`\cos\theta` due to the use of another coordinate system, compare Figure 2.1 from Gumerov and Duraiswami and :numref:`fig-coordinate-system`.

.. [#F2]  Note the :math:`\frac{1}{2\pi}` term is wrong in [Ahrens2012]_, eq. (3.21) and eq. (5.7) and omitted here, compare the `errata <http://www.soundfieldsynthesis.org/errata/>`_ and [SchultzSpors2014]_, eq. (24).

.. [#F3] Compare the assumptions made before (15) in [SporsZotter2013]_, which lead to the derivation of the same window function in a more explicit way.

.. [#F4]  The solution mentioned by [LaxFeshbach1947]_ assumes that the listener is far away from the radiator and that the radiator is a physical source not a notional one as the secondary sources. In this case the selection criterion has to be chosen more carefully, incorporating the exact position of the listener and the virtual source. See also the `related discussion <https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs-documentation/issues/8>`_.

.. [#F5] Note that Williams defines the Fourier transform with transposed signs as :math:`F(\w) = \int f(t) \e{\i\w t}`. This leads also to changed signs in his definitions of the Greenâ€™s functions and field expansions.

.. [#F6] Whereby :math:`r` corresponds to :math:`|\x_0-\xs|` and :math:`\cos\varphi` to :math:`\frac{\scalarprod{\x_0-\xs}{\n_{\x_0}}}{|\x_0-\xs|}`.
