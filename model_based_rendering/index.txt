Model-Based Rendering
---------------------

Knowing the pressure field of the desired source :math:`S(\x,\w)` is
required in order to derive the driving signal for the secondary source
distribution. It can either be measured, i.e.Â recorded, or modeled. While the
former is known as *data-based rendering*, the latter is known as *model-based
rendering*.  For data-based rendering, the problem of how to capture a complete
sound field still has to be solved. [Avni2013]_ et al. discuss some influences
of the recording limitations on the perception of the reproduced sound field.
This document will consider only model-based rendering.

Frequently applied models in model-based rendering are plane waves, point
sources, or sources with a prescribed complex directivity. In the following the
models used within the SFS Toolbox are presented.
