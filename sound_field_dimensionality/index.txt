Sound Field Dimensionality
--------------------------

The single-layer potentialÂ :eq:`single-layer` is valid for all :math:`V \subset
{\mathbb{R}}^n`.  Consequentially, for practical applications a two-dimensional
(2D) as well as a three-dimensional (3D) synthesis is possible. Two-dimensional
is not referring to a synthesis in a plane only, but describes a setup that is
independent of one dimension. For example, an infinite cylinder is independent
of the dimension along its axis. The same is true for secondary source
distributions in 2D synthesis.  They exhibit line source characteristics and are
aligned in parallel to the independent dimension. Typical arrangements of such
secondary sources are a circular or a linear setup.

The characteristics of the secondary sources limit the set of possible sources
which can be synthesized. For example, when using a 2D secondary source setup it
is not possible to synthesize the amplitude decay of a point source.

For a 3D synthesis the involved secondary sources depend on all dimensions and
exhibit point source characteristics. In this scenario classical secondary
sources setups would be a sphere or a plane.
