Driving functions for |WFS|
---------------------------

In the following, the driving functions for |WFS| in the frequency and temporal
domain for selected source models are presented. The temporal domain functions
consist of a filtering of the source signal and a weighting and delaying of the
individual secondary source signals. This property allows for a very efficient
implementation of |WFS| driving functions in the temporal domain. It is one of the
main advantages of |WFS| in comparison to most of the |NFC-HOA|, |SDM| solutions
discussed above.
